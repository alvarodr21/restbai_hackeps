## AIccessibility for everyone
An implementation of the idea that everyone deserves a suitable home. Created using APIs in order to help people with reduced mobility filter out the properties that don't adapt to their needs.

## Inspiration

We wanted to make property buying easier for those with special mobility needs (such as having no stairs in their home or having an elevator they can use). Restb.ai let us use their APIs with models based on detailed information about Real State, and we wanted to use them for good.
## What it does

Given either an imput of the information of the location of a home in the US (Street, City, Zip code, State and Country) or a link to a picture from the inside of a home, our implementation will output its accessibility value for a person with reduced mobility, ranked out of ten, based on a formula based on our criteria.
## How we built it

We used JavaScript and React Native in order to implement the APIs endpoints on an interface, we developed the front and backend of the project with the same resources. Given the information from the dataset about Real State, we decided how to weigh each parameter so that we could have a formula that calculates how accessible is a house for a person with reduced mobility.
## Challenges we ran into

At first we needed to install node on our Windows and it took a lot of time to do so, we had to learn a lot of the basis of all that we were going to use because most of our team barely knew anything.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

At first we did not think we were capable of representing the idea that we had in mind. But little by little, we created the project. We are proud because we have surpassed our limits and have created something that can be useful for some people.
What we learned

We have learned what is an API, how to interact with it and how to use Postman. We have also grown in confidence around github and its commands. Javascript, and specifically React, have been necessary in our project, so, in order to use them, we have had to learn the basics of these frameworks. It has also helped us to work in group and know are teammates better.
## What's next for AIccessibility for everyone

We can expand the algorithm as much as we want. For instance, we can look for other parameters like the streetsâ€™ inclination, or modify them in order to give more importance to the selected properties. We can also make the implementation more specific, in order to narrow down the mobility reduction and find even better candidates.
